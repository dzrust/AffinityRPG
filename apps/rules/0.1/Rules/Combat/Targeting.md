# Targeting
This is how the hostiles decide who they are going to attack.

## Targetting flow

1. They will choose their closest target.
2. If two or more targets are equal distance away assign a number 1-6 between targets and roll 1d6 to determine target
3. If they are unable to reach their target with their actions they will start from step 1
4. Unless otherwise specified by Action Deck they will keep their target until either their hp is <=0 or their target's hp is <=0
