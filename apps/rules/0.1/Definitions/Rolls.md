# Rolls

Rolls give unique opportunities for the [GG](Definitions/Game_Guide) and the [PCs](Definitions/Player) to create unique situations that no one was planning for. Although completely optional and the [GG](Definitions/Game_Guide) can decide the outcome of each action or interaction. It is highly recomended that all involved use dice to create an engaging and unique system.

## Abbreviation

1d6: One dice that has six sides on it. Each side must be unique to determine the outcome and should be mapped to the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6

nd6: n represents a number of dice. This should be defined by whatever calls it. For example:
`Roll nd6 dice where n is Potency.`

```
Example:
If your Potency was 5 you would roll 5d6.
```

## Type of rolls

These are the various types of rolls that [players](Definitions/Player) can make.

### Rating

Rating is how well the [hero](Definitions/Hero) completed a task. When rolling to classify how well something happend you can follow the table below. Use the result table below to determine the number and quality of success.

| Number of skill checks succeeded | Rating    |
| -------------------------------- | --------- |
| 0                                | Failure   |
| 1                                | Common    |
| 2                                | Uncommon  |
| 4                                | Rare      |
| 6                                | Legendary |

### Damage

Damage is how much damage the [hero](Definitions/Hero). You will use the base damage from your used weapon or mastery and add [potency](Definitions/Stats/Potency) roll to the damage.

### Accuracy

Hit is whether or not the [hero](Definitions/Hero) was able to aim towards their target. You will use [finesse](Definitions/Stats/Finesse) to determine whether your aim allowed you to hit your target or not. This will be used for physical and magical attacks in close and ranged combat. You will follow the result table to determine the outcome

### Skill

Skill is used when the [hero](Definitions/Hero) is performing a skill related check. The [GG](Definitions/Game_Guide) determines the [DS](Definitions/Difficulty_Setting) and then the player rolls nd6 based on their level. Following the result table

Any result that of rolls that is greater than 0 succeeds. Any result equal to or less than 0 fails.

## Skill difficulty

| Number of skill checks succeeded | Difficulty     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 0                                | Every day task |
| 1                                | Easy           |
| 2                                | Medium         |
| 4                                | Hard           |
| 6                                | Very Hard      |
| 8                                | Legendary      |

## Progressive Skill Checks

Anything requiring multiple in succession will follow this sequence:

1. Roll Skill Check
2. If failed stop look at rating determined by number of successes or if passed based on difficulty
3. If success discard dice that represent the 1 and 2 side keep all other
4. repeat steps 1 through 3 until legendary rating has been achieved.
