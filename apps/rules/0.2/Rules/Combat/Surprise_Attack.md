# Surprise Attack

When the Surprise Attack is declared, the ones being surprised must not be aware of those declaring the surprise attack.

## Those declaring the surprise

Must collectively roll nd6 where n is their [Finesse](Definitions/Stats/Finesse)

## Those being surprised

Must collectively roll nd6 where n is their [Vigor](Definitions/Stats/Vigor)

```
Example:
Hero 1: 4 Finesse = 4d6 // Rolled 18
Hero 2: 2 Finesse = 2d6 // Rolled 11
Hero 3: 4 Finesse = 4d6 // Rolled 13
Total: 42

Hostile 1: 6 Vigor = 6d6 // Rolled 19
Hostile 2: 3 Vigor = 3d6 // Rolled 10
Total: 29

The Heroes succeed in a surprise attack because their collective total was higher than the hostiles.
```

## Determining outcome

Whether success or failure [Turn Order](Rules/Combat/Turn_Order) will be rolled first. Then if the surprise attack succeeds a single turn is acted upon where those who succeeded go and everyone else is skipped. If it failed [combat](Rules/Combat/README) starts as usual.
