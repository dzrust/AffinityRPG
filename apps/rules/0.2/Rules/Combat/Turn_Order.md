# Turn Order

Turn order determines the flow of [Combat](Rules/Combat/README). Each [Hero](Definitions/Hero) and [NPC](Definitions/NPC) performs an intiative check to determine when they will act in combat.

## Initiative Check

Initiative checks are nd6 where n is [Finesse](Definitions/Stats/Finesse).

```
Example:
Hero has a Finesse of 2. 2d6
```

### Additional Rulings

- If there are duplicate rolls on initiative checks then whoever has higher Finesse wins
  - If all are equal then [Heroes](Definitions/Hero) go before [NPC](Definitions/NPC)
