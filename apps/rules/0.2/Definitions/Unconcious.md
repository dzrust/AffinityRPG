# Unconcious

When a [being](Definitions/Being) has taken more damage than they have [Health](Definitions/Stats/Health) they become unconcious. To recover from this state they must have one of the following occur:

- Enter into a restful state to recover HP
  - Combat ceases
  - No [hostiles](Definitions/NPC#hostile) within 100 [DU](Definitions/Unit#distance) of [being](Definitions/Being)
- Receive medical aid
  - An item restoring [HP](Definitions/Stats/Health) restores the [being](Definitions/Being) to greater than 0 [HP](Definitions/Health)
  - A spell restoring [HP](Definitions/Stats/Health) restores the [being](Definitions/Being) to greater than 0 [HP](Definitions/Stats/Health)
  - A medicine check is succeeds and restores the [being](Definitions/Being) to greater than 0 [HP](Definitions/Stats/Health)

If the [being](Definitions/Being) does not regain [HP](Definitions/Stats/Health) after five combat turns they pass away.
